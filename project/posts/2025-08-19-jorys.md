I was still affected by some fatigue today but I managed to finish Aitayah-MacDonald's Chapter 2 on modules, learning about tensor products and exact sequences among other things, and read Jänich's Chapters 4 to 6 on Quotient Spaces, Completion of Metric Spaces and Homotopy (finally!).

This represents my first step within the realms of algebraic topology, a field which I have been eager to discover since I learned about the Poincaré's conjecture during my first year of university.

$$ \text{Something about homotopy...} $$

I also watched a lecture by Professor Pierre Deligne at the Institute of Advanced Studies in 1996 on [L'œuvre d'Alexandre Grothendieck](https://youtu.be/PeMAyPGjL68?si=_Bxt0u5tTFaNsJCM).

I could only understand the first few minutes but was quickly lost in mathematical formalism I currently don't know about. It was still nice  to be carried along by the poetry of Grothendieck's mathematical work beautifully counted by Deligne. I could still understand the landscape  of Grothendieck's work as well as understanding even more how commutative algebra served as a pillar on which he could build his theories, enforcing  my motivation to understand deeply the content of this field.
