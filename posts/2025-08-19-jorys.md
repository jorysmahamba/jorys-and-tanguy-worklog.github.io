I advanced in the study of modules but I struggled with exact sequences and barely touched to tensor products yet. The concept of an exact sequence itself is not hard at all but the proofs are complicated to work out correctly directly in my head as I am used to be when reading a mathematical textbook...


I also watched a lecture by Professor Pierre Deligne at the Institute for Advanced Studies in 1996 on [L'œuvre d'Alexandre Grothendieck](https://youtu.be/PeMAyPGjL68?si=_Bxt0u5tTFaNsJCM).

I could only understand the first few minutes but was quickly lost in mathematical formalism I currently don't know about. It was still nice  to be carried along by the poetry of Grothendieck's mathematical work beautifully counted by Deligne. I could still understand the landscape  of Grothendieck's work as well as understanding even more how commutative algebra served as a pillar on which he could build his theories, enforcing  my motivation to understand deeply the content of this field.
