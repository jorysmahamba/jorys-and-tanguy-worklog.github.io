**Functional Analysis**

Continued to follow the MIT *Introduction to Functional Analysis* class and covered redoing the proofs:
  * In a Bsp, absolutely summable implies summable,
  * The characterization of Banach spaces via Cauchy sequences,
  * The operator 

$$
Tf(x) = \int^1_0K(x,y)f(y)dy
$$

on $C([0, 1])$ is linear and bounded by $\|Tf\|_\infty \leq \|K\|_\infty \|f\|_\infty$ .

* Boundeness of a linear operator imples continuity and vice versa,
* Operator norm (defined by $\|T\| := \sup_{\|v\| = 1, v \in V} \|Tv\|$)
* Completeness of $B(V, W)$: if $W$ is a Bsp, then $B(V, W)$ is also a Bsp.

**Evolutionnary Strategy**

I began exploring *The CMA Evolution Strategy: A Tutorial* by Nikolaus Hansen, to deepen my understanding on how CMA-ES adjust the covariance matrix and the step size at each iterations.
