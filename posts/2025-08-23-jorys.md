Continuing from my discovery of categories yesterday I learnt about functors today. They have a rather trivial definition but it is amazing how powerful they are: 
one can directly notice that a lot of constructions they know are a functor betweeen some categories. Knowing that I am just at Ch. 1 ยง3 makes me really curious about 
the potential of category theory and functioriality. I can't wait to learn more!
