Reviewed Banach Space theory including:
* Finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces
* Normed spaces and Banach spaces
* Some examples of Banach spaces (little lp spaces, space of bounded continuous functions on a metric space)

Exercised by proving that:
$$
C_0 := \{a \in l^\infty \mid \lim_{j \to \infty} a_j = 0 \} 
$$

with norm $\|a\|_\infty = \sup_{1 \leq j \leq \infty} \|a_j\|$ $is a Banach Space.
